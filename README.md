# ethereum-price-monitor

## What does it do ?

It adds a little Chrome extension to monitor the price of Ethereum on GDAX. It updates every 10 seconds. Handy for those of you that want to keep an inconspicuous eye on the price of Ether.

## How do I install it ?

It's not available in the Chrome app store yet as I need to muster up $5.

You can just install it manually tho. 

1. Download the zip [https://github.com/PeanutPete/ethereum-price-monitor/archive/master.zip].
2. Unzip it to a folder.
2. Browse to chrome://extensions
3. Turn on developer mode in the top right.
4. Click the load unpacked button link, browse to the unzipped folder and hit open.

That's It! You should now have a little extension in your Chrome toolbar that shows the price of Ether. Yay.

It will be available on the app store once I get $5 :)

Thanks :)
