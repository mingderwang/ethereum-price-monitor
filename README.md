## What does it do ?

It adds a little Chrome extension to monitor the price of Ethereum on GDAX. It updates every 10 seconds. Handy for those of you that want to keep an inconspicuous eye on the price of Ether.

## How do I install it ?

Since I have recently achieved my ultimate business goal of mustering up $5 I will upload this to the Chrome app store asap. (done)

You can install it via the app store or install it manually as below.

App Store 

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ethereum-price-monitor/pnjahgmogdobjnkeeehjploidboncjke]

Manually. 

1. Download the zip [https://github.com/PeanutPete/ethereum-price-monitor/archive/master.zip].
2. Unzip it to a folder.
2. Browse to chrome://extensions
3. Turn on developer mode in the top right corner.
4. Click the load unpacked button, browse to the unzipped folder and hit open.

That's It! You should now have a little extension in your Chrome toolbar that shows the price of Ether. Yay.

Donations welcome at 0x4CC792aA6B191ddEfbceb2e0b8c6d043B6EE1bDC.

It will be available on the app store once I stop checking gdax and have a chance to upload it :)

Thanks :)
